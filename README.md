A sample command-line application to solve hexadoku game.

It use dart as the programming language and recursion & backtracking strategy


## Run

`dart main.dart`

You can pass the '-i console', which means take input from the stdin, 

or '-i path', which meas take input from file

## Test
`pub run test`

Currently, just one test case to assure that the input is in right format

## TODO

The current implementation using recursion & backtracking strategy takes about 38 seconds to get a solution.

Absolutely needs improvement by gaining more insight on this problem.
